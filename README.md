# p4dlg

### A set of *abstractions* that use SQL, supported by a common set of APIs, to interact with your Perforce instance and its resources.

While I work on formal documentation, this README should at least give you an idea of what *p4dlg* is. There are also working samples and examples in /p4q/libsample.

### All abstractions, whatever they support, adhere to the same syntax, conventions and functionality. The following examples can be applied, conceptually, to any abstraction covered in this readme.

## How do we use *p4dlg*?
Though *p4dlg* can be imported and used in script or broader programs, it can also be used interactively in an IPython QT shell (included in this package) where p4dlg is fully baked into it. Just type the following cmdline to start it up!

```Python
%> python dlg.py shell
```

* Please look in the /p4dlg/libsample directory for a more examples & samples.

# Connectors
## P4Jnl
### Access all your metadata without being hindered by proprietary hurdles and without any perforce client or admin program. It is our data after all.

### basics
A checkpoint is a snapshot, a textual representation of your Perforce DB. As records are created, the server outputs the journal data to an ongoing file (until truncated). Conversely, checkpoints and journals (or fragments thereof) can be used to rebuild your database or modified to update existing records (checkpoint surgery). In other words, they can be used to insert, update, delete & query records.

### A sample journal fragment.
```Python

```

It kind of looks like a .CSV file, but without column headers. P4D does not discriminate, each line is a record of some kind of transaction, regardless of table, in order and as it occures. Therefore a proficient knowledge of the p4 schema is nice to have. Luckily, that know-how is baked-in to p4dlg, for any server/schema release.

### Create or load an existing connection.
```Python
# Use `jnlconnect` to manage connections.
# methods:    create - load - update - unload - destroy - purge - show
# `jnlconnect` attributes: create    create and store a connection to a journal
#                          load      load an existing connector
#                          update    update a connector's values
#                          unload    unload a connectior from the current scope
#                          destroy   destroy an existing connector
#                          purge     combines unload/destroy
#                          show      display the the data that defined the object
#                          
# Create a connection to a journal with jnlconnect.create
# parameters: args[0]  -> name,
#             keyword  -> journal = journal_path
#             keyword  -> version = release of the p4d instance
#                                   that created the journal
#             keyword  -> oSchema = the schema that that defines the p4db
#
#             Note that keywords `version` & `oSchema` are mutually exclusive.
#             Pass in one or the orther.
#             * a bit more on schemas further down. 
In [17]: jnlconnect.create('jnl',
                        **{
                           'journal': './resc/journals/checkpoint.rasp',
                           'version': 'r16.2'
                           }
                       )

# the connectors are persistent & p4dlg keeps track to make them available for reuse. The can be loaded at any time.
In [18]: jnlcon.load('jnl')
Reference (jnl) loaded
Out[18]: <P4Jnl ./resc/journals/journal.8>
```

### Query syntax
```Python
#                     table     op    value
#                      |        |      |
In [19]: qry = (jnl.domain.type == 'client')
#                |           |
#             connector    column
```

### Building a query.
```Python
In [20]: qry = (jnl.domain.type == 'client')     # A simple query.
In [21]: qry
Out[21]: 
<DLGQuery {'inversion': False,                   # A query is a reference to class `DLGQuery`.
 'left': <JNLField type>,
 'objp4': <P4Jnl ./resc/journals/journal.8>,     
 'op': <function EQ at 0x104d32700>,
 'right': 'client'}>
```

Passing in a query to the connector's __call__ method, forces it to return a set of records, *DLGRecordSet*.
The set of records are not the same as the selected records. It is basically a generator with useful methods
and attributes.
### Connector + query = recordset
```Python
In [22]: recordste = jnl(qry)                    # Connection objects are callable, take queries and expose
                                                 # useful attributes such as  `select`, `fetch`, update, etc.
In [23]: RECORDSET
Out[23]: <DLGRecordSet (<class 'libjnl.jnlFile.JNLFile'>)>

In [24]: clients = recordset.select()            # equivalent to `SELECT * FROM domain WHERE type = client`
In [25]: clients
Out[25]: <DLGRecords (188)>                      # The target journal defines 188 `clientspec` records.
```

## Selecting records / syntax
### Typing the thing as a one liner, say in an interactive QT Console, flows from the end of your finger tips.
```Python
In [26]: clients = jnl(jnl.domain.type == 'client').select()
Out[26]: <DLGRecords (188)>
```
### Break it down to its syntactical parts.
```
In [27]: client_recordset = jnl(jnl.domain.type == 'client')
```

eg.
```Python

In [27]: qry = (jnl.domain.type == 'client')

```

```Python
In [28]: clients.first()                         # `clients` is a reference to class `DLGRecords`, and
                                                 # exposes interesting SQL attributes.
Out[28]: 
<DLGRecord {'accessDate': '2021/11/14',          # `DLGRecords` contains references to class `DLGRecord`
 'db_action': 'pv',
 'description': 'Created by bert.\n',
 'extra': 'desktop_bert',

 'serverid': '',
 'stream': '',
 'table_name': 'db.domain',
 'table_revision': '6',
 'type': '99',
 'updateDate': '2021/11/14'}>
```

### A connnector has useful attributes
eg.
```Python
# List all available table for this version
jnl.tables
Out[29]: 
['config',
 'counters',
 'nameval',
 'logger',
 'ldap',
 'server',
 'svrview',
 'remote',
 'rmtview',
 'stash',
 'userrp',
 'user',
 'group',
...
]

# Once referenced, a table object becomes acceesible as an attribute of said connection object.

In [30]: jnl.domain
Out[30]: <libjnl.jnlSqltypes.JNLTable at 0x16099e210>      # A table is a reference to class JNLTable (in this case).
In [31]: jnl.domain.fields                                 # A table object exposes its fields and other usefull attributes.
Out[31]: 
[<JNLField idx>,
 <JNLField db_action>,
 <JNLField table_revision>,
 <JNLField table_name>,
 <JNLField name>,
 <JNLField type>,
 <JNLField extra>,
 <JNLField mount>,
 <JNLField mount2>,
 <JNLField mount3>,
 <JNLField owner>,
 <JNLField updateDate>,
 <JNLField accessDate>,
 <JNLField options>,
 <JNLField description>,
 <JNLField stream>,
 <JNLField serverid>,
 <JNLField partition>]

In [32]: jnl.domain.desc                                   # The tables description attribute, as per the referenced schema.
Out[33]: 'Domains: depots, clients, labels, branches, streams, and typemap'

In [34]: jnl.domain.type                                   # The table's field objects are exposed.
Out[34]: <JNLField type>

In [35]: jnl.domain.type.desc                              # A table's field attributes can be accessed.
Out[35]: 'Type of domain'

```

## Agregators Operators, Expressions, Queries etc.

eg. Group client (domain) records by `name` & order them by `accessDate`.
```Python
In [36]: client_groups = clients.groupby('name', orderby=jnl.domain.accessdate, groupdict=True)

# The `groupdict` attribute modifies groupby's return type. When set to True (False is the default),
# it will not return the set of records, as we would expect, but instead, a dict where the keys are the 
# field values that make up the tagret group names. The values are the records belonging to the field 
# that groups the the records.

In [37]: client_groups
Out[37]:

In [38]: for client in client_groups.linuxclient:
    print(client.name, client.accessdate)
    
linuxclient 2021/11/24                # Though perforce stores datetime values in linux time, p4dlg converts them

### More examples below on the use of aggregators, operators, queries, expressions, etc., as well as p4dlg's take on using SQL mechanics to drive interactions with a Perforce instance.

## Py4
### A client program, A wrapper, an abstraction layer over the p4 cmd line client API probably describes it better. If you're like me, you have favoured the more robust and never failing cmd line client when interacting with your Perforce server. So using this connector might be counter intiative, at first. If we are to think SQL instead of `executable cmd *args`, we must alter our mind set, a little bit. Please, bare with me & let's just rip off the bandaid.

Let's forget the executable, the command and everything else that comes after that. I propose instead that we accept a new Perforce where the executable no longer an executable but rather a name. That is a name of a connection to a DB (after all the P4DB is just that, a DB). ALong the same lines, a command is no longer a command, but rather a table. Think of Postgres or mysql. Like that. Of course if we think of tables, we will start seeing fields with values. Here's what I mean:
